This repository contains Python code in a Jupyter Notebook that converts BibTeX files to CSV format. It also includes functionality to filter entries based on specific topics.

Features:

--Converts a BibTeX file into a structured CSV file using a Jupyter Notebook.

--Extracts specific columns (url, publisher, year, title, and ID) from the BibTeX data.

--Filters entries based on relevant keywords in the paper title.

--Outputs a CSV file with only relevant research papers.

Tip: It is recommended to keep the BibTeX file in the same directory where the Jupyter Notebook is located. This makes it easier to manage file paths and avoids file not found errors.
